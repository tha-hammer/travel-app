# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a travel application project. The codebase is currently in early development phase.

## Development Setup

This project appears to be newly initialized. Common setup tasks will likely include:

- Initialize package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Set up project structure
- Configure build tools and development environment
- Add testing framework

## Architecture Notes

Project architecture will be determined as development progresses. Key considerations for a travel app typically include:

- User authentication and profiles
- Trip planning and itinerary management
- Location services and mapping integration
- Booking and reservation systems
- Data persistence and API integration

## Notes

- This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure and development workflows are established
- Add specific build, test, and deployment commands once the project tooling is configured
